Analysis tool for the CAFE class.
Author: Aleksandar Dimitrov

Depends on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, 6.10.x (www.haskell.or/ghc).  To build
it, it's advisable to have the Cabal build system installed (www.haskell.org/cabal).

Then it's as easy as typing:

> cabal configure
> cabal build
> cabal install

at a command line (or just 'cabal configure && cabal install'). After
installation, executables can be found in ~/.cabal/bin or ./dist/build/analyse.

Since this system does not (for now) depend on 3rd party libraries, one can also
build it directly with ghc:

> cd ./src
> ghc --make -O2 -fglasgow-exts -o analyse -Wall Main.hs

Invocation of the executable:

analyse [-v] -c CORPUS -l {german,english}
